# -Human-in-the-loop-Design-with-CNN-and-LSTM-Model-for-Emotion-Recognition

• Built a predictive model to analyze the Emotions for Text Dataset using CNN and LSTM models.
• Integrating the machine learning model with the Human-in-the-loop design for accepting feedback from the user to increase the model performance without retraining the model for the new input data.
• Design a User Interface to display Model prediction and accept User Feedback to enhance model accuracy.
• Tools – Google Colab, Python, Pandas, NumPy, Keras, NLTK, JavaScript, ReactJS
